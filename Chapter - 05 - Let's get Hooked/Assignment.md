# Chapter 05 - Let's Get Hooked!

## Theory Assignment:
1. **What is the `difference` between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?**  
2. **What is the `importance` of the `config.js` file in a project?**  
3. **What are `React Hooks`, and how do they enhance functional components?**  
4. **Why is the `useState Hook` essential in React applications?**

## Coding Assignment:
1. **Clean up your codebase** to make it more organized and readable.  
2. **Create a well-structured folder system** for your app, ensuring clear separation of concerns (e.g., components, assets, utils).  
3. **Split your app into multiple files** by creating separate files for each component.  
4. **Create a `config.js` file** to centralize configuration settings such as API endpoints, reusable constants, etc.  
5. **Use all types of `import and export`** in your project:  
   - Named exports  
   - Default exports  
   - `* as` exports  

6. **Build a functional `Search Box` in your app:**  
   - Use the `useState` Hook to declare and manage the search input state.  
   - Bind the state variable to the input box.  
   - Add functionality to make the search bar work by filtering a list of items based on user input.
