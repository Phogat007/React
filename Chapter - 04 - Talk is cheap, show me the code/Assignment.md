# Chapter 04 - Talk is Cheap, Show Me the Code

## Theory Assignment:
- Is `JSX` essential for React?
- Is `ES6` necessary to work with React?
- Compare `{TitleComponent}`, `{<TitleComponent/>}`, and `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in `JSX`.
- How do you write `comments` in JSX?
- Explain `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and its shorthand `<></>`.
- What is `Reconciliation` in React?
- What is `React Fiber`?
- Why are `keys` important in React?
- Can `index` be used as `keys` in React? When should it be avoided?
- What are `props` in React? How can you pass them?
- Explain the concept of `Config Driven UI`.


## Coding Assignment:
- Develop a `Food Ordering App`:
    - Come up with a `cool and unique name` for your app.
    - Design an `AppLayout`.
    - Create a `Header Component` featuring the `Logo`, `Navigation Items`, and `Cart`.
    - Build a `Body Component`:
        - Develop a `RestaurantList Component`.
        - Create a `RestaurantCard Component`:
            - Start with `static data`.
            - Make the `cards dynamic` by passing data using `props`.
                - Utilize `Destructuring` and the `Spread operator` to handle `props`.
            - Render the cards dynamically using `restaurant data`.
            - Use `Array.map` to loop through and render the list of restaurants.

### Reminder: Follow the same sequence as discussed in the class. Pay attention to every detail and avoid skipping any steps.
